## My Response
I thrive in an environment that is ever changing, ever challenging, and 
where people work their butts off. But there has to be a balance; people should
also be encouraged to celebrate victories, big and small, and to have fun and 
value self-care. I was brought up with the team mentality; in sports in particular, 
but I value and embrace the same teamwork principles in my academic and professional
careers. In other words, I believe that projects are most successful when people
collaborate and communicate, challenge and encourage each other, and appreciate
that everyone brings value to the group. I also work best on diverse teams where
everyone can learn from each other or fill in each other's gaps in skills; I love
being able to and also need to be able to constantly learn new things or else I 
get complacent (when things get too familiar or constant). It also helps when I get
along with the people I work with outside of work. I can definitely work with anyone,
but I have found that I do better work when the people I work with are respectful
and just generally enjoyable. All that said, I am also super adaptable so I can work
well in most circumstances, with most people, and I enjoy morphing and growing to 
best fit and best support the team I am a part of.
