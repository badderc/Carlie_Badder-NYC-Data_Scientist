## Results Commentary
Because you cannot see my actual score, I will mention that, aside from the extroverted 
category, I scored right around the 50-60% for every other result. I have taken this test 
in the past and it's been slightly different any time. I touch on this in my free response
answer, but I am super adaptable to my current situation. In general, I am definitely 
sociable and outgoing, but depending on what's required according to the rest of the 
people in the room, on the team, on the project, etc, I can either be the planner or
the spontaneous free-thinker. It's definitely one of my strengths, but this personality 
test makes it come across as though I don't consider the consequences of my immediate actions, 
which I definitely do. I'm a fairly anxious person when it comes to other people relying or
depending on me; fortunately the anxiety drives me to work really hard, for other people. If 
it's just me depending on me to do something, I have less motivation, which is I think what the 
Entertainer personality is capturing - I'm much more go with the flow when I'm not responsible 
for anything important or for anyone else/else's feelings or work. Hopefully, I've clarified 
these results a little bit.
