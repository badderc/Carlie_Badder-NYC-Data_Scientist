    "Often, complicated problems can be broken down into a simple pictoral representation of data. For example, take the example of building a representation of an image on your computer. Images can be represented as a collection of pixels, where each pixel has a location and a color.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about the simplest representation of an image, a pure black and white image. A black and white image can be represented by a two-dimensional list of 0's and 1's. For example if we think about the representation of an image, an example of an image could look like this, where 0's represent the pixel being off and 1's represent the pixel being on. \n",
